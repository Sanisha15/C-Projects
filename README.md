This C code represents a text-based game called "SNAKE THE CONQUEROR." In this game, you control a snake on a grid, and your goal is to outsmart a computer opponent. Here's how the game works:

1. You and the CPU take turns moving the snake on a grid.
2. The snake starts at the top-left corner, represented by '*'.
3. You move the snake using the keys 8 (up), 2 (down), 4 (left), and 6 (right).
4. The CPU randomly selects moves for the snake on its turn.
5. The game ends when there are no more valid moves left.
6. Your objective is to trap the CPU, preventing it from making valid moves.
7. To win, you must be the last one to make a move.

Remember these key rules:
- The snake must not hit the boundaries of the grid.
- The snake must avoid crossing its own body.
- You must outmaneuver the CPU to win.

After the game ends, the code displays whether you've won or lost and the maximum snake length achieved. Enjoy the game!
